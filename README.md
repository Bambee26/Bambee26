## About Me
### Professionally

I've been a producer analyst with Premera Blue Cross in Washington State for over 10 years. I'm a full-time telecommuter, which I love. Fun fact though, pre-pandemic, I loved being in the office and worked from home only when necessary. I love the company I work for and hope to stay til (early) retirement. 

### Academically

I currently have my bachelor's degree in Health Sciences from Arizona State University. I graduated there in 2017 and was stuck on where to go next. I really wanted to improve the technical skills that are relevant to my current role, so I enrolled at Northwest Missouri State University to pursue my graduate degree in Data Analytics. 

### Personally

I live in Southern California with my husband and our three dogs (often 4 if we have a foster dog). Our son is a freshman at Texas State University. In my spare time, I love to go lift weights, go to Disneyland or travel in our RV. We also spend a lot of time volunteering with a local dog rescue - Underdog Heroes.
